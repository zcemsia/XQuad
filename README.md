# XQuad
XQuad is a drone simulator designed for engineers to test new PID and airframe parameters before building a real prototype.

XQuad is integrated with a genetic algorithm that looks to optimise flight performance when given new frame and motor parameters. (Feature currently under construction.)

XQuad can be used to develop full system parameters when given specific mission criteria, such as waypoint locations and payload. (Feature currently under construction.)
